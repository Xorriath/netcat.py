# netcat
A netcat-like tool that works on both Windows and Linux.
Currently it can be used in both client and server mode on both Windows and Linux using the same file. In listening `-l` mode, it binds to the specified IP and port and waits for incoming connections. In client mode(default if `-l` is ommited) it connects to the target server, the server receiving a shell like reverse shell.
